   <h2>Melanie Martinez</h2>
   <p>Melanie Martinez is a muscial artist. She encorporates unique arrangements to her music. She doesn't follow what<br> others expect from her. With her album K-12 she created a visual album that was stunning. Everything from her <br> style, to music, to her performance work is spectacular.</p>

  <h2>Tati Moon</h2>
  <p>Tati Moon is a disabled digital artist that is from Germany. Her work reminds me a lot of the type of drawings <br> I did when I was younger (except her work is far better.) I found her during the 2020 pandemic lockdown and <br>she inspired me to begin drawing again. I love her use of color which is something I lack in my own art style.</p>

  <h2>Rikki-Kay Middleton</h2>
  <p>I draw a lot of inspiration for my own work from tattoos, especially because I typically work in black and white. <br>Rikki-Kay is a tattoo artist. I love her techniques for shading. She combines shading, stippling and sketching to create <br> a unique style of work.  </p>
